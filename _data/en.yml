about_content: <p>Since 2007 I have been producing Street Art in plublic spaces. To do so I try to find a good combination between location, design and subject. Sometimes I do this by painting more realistic of historic murals, in other cases my work in more colorfull and illustrative. </p>
  <p>Besides my regular work I often work on commission for companies, councils, schools, festivals and other initiatives.</p>
